# Personal Digital Assistant

### ABSTRACT
This is one of the exciting ideas for an artificial intelligence project. Personal assistants with voice capabilities are useful tools for streamlining daily duties. Virtual voice assistants, for example, can be used to compose notes and set reminders, shop for products on your behalf, search for goods and services on the Internet, and much more.This voice-activated virtual assistant was created especially for Windows. This assistant for Windows allows users to use voice commands like "open" to launch any application (such as Notepad, File Explorer, Google Chrome, etc.). Important messages can also be written with the "write" voice command.In a similar vein, "search" is the voice command for doing an Internet search.The NLP-trained assistant will hear the speech and record the command in the database because it is trained to comprehend natural human language. It will use the spoken phrase to determine the user's intent and adjust the action accordingly. It is also capable of turning text to speech.

### INTRODUCTION
In today’s era almost all tasks are digitalized. We have Smartphone in hands and it is nothing less than having world at your finger tips. These days we aren’t even using fingers. We just speak of the task and it is done. There exist systems where we can say Text Dad, “I’ll be late today.” And the text is sent. That is the task of a Virtual Assistant. It also supports specialized task such as booking a flight, or finding cheapest book online from various e- commerce sites and then providing an interface to book an order are helping automate search, discovery and online order operations.Virtual Assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, such as showing weather report, creating reminders, making shopping lists etc. They can take commands via text (online chat bots) or by voice.

### OBJECTIVES
Main objective of building personal assistant software (a virtual assistant) is using semantic data sources available on the web, user generated content and providing knowledge from knowledge databases. The main purpose of an intelligent virtual assistant is to answer questions that users may have. This may be done in a business environment, for example, on the business website, with a chat interface. On the mobile platform, the intelligent virtual assistant is available as a call-button operated service where a voice asks the user “What can I do for you?” and then responds to verbal input.
One of the main advantages of voice searches is their rapidity. In fact, voice is reputed to be four times faster than a written search: whereas we can write about 40 words per minute, we are capable of speaking around 150 during the same period of time15. In this respect, the ability of personal assistants to accurately recognize spoken words is a prerequisite for them to be adopted by consumers.

### CONCLUSION
Personal Digital Assistant helpful for normal people and blind/visually impaired by having the natural dialogue with the system. The modules of this system makes it flexible , easy to use and easy to add additional features without disturbing current system functionality. In the PDA system we have built the Speech Recognition module, Speech To Text, Text To Speech News Feed module, Mathematical module, etc.

### FUTURE SCOPE
<ul>
    <li>Home Automation using microcontrollers can be included in the project.</li>
    <li>Invoice recognition: Eliminate external or background voice interference.</li>
  </ul>
